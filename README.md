# Developing a Personalized AI Research Assistant with Memory

An intelligent and adaptable AI assistant that can analyze documents, conduct independent research, and remember past interactions to provide personalized, contextually relevant support.

## Overview
This project is a full-stack AI research assistant application built to provide an engaging and personalized experience. The assistant is capable of:

- Parsing and summarizing documents (PDF, DOCX, DOC) using Langchain and document loaders.
- Conducting independent research via external tools (e.g., Bing Search via SerpAPI).
- Maintaining conversational context and memory to tailor its responses.
- Adapting its personality based on user preferences (e.g., factual, friendly, humorous).

The backend is developed using **FastAPI** (Python) and integrates with Azure OpenAI and Langchain. The frontend is built with **Next.js** (TypeScript) and styled with **TailwindCSS**, ensuring a minimal yet modern UI.

## Features
- **Document Processing:**
  - Parse various document formats using libraries like PyMuPDF and python-docx.
  - Generate summaries with Langchain’s summarization chain.
  - Store document data in a vector database (e.g., FAISS) for efficient retrieval.

- **AI Assistant:**
  - Integrates with Azure OpenAI using Langchain’s chat models.
  - Maintains session history to provide memory and context.
  - Customizable personality settings (factual, friendly, humorous).
  - Capable of answering questions based on the document summary and previous interactions.

- **Research Tool Integration:**
  - Uses SerpAPI (via Langchain’s `SerpAPIWrapper`) to conduct external research.
  - Seamlessly incorporates research findings into the AI assistant’s responses.

- **Frontend UI:**
  - Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.
  - Minimal, stylish, and responsive design.
  - Displays uploaded document content, summary, and research findings.
  - Provides a personality selector for customizing the assistant’s communication style.

## Setup Instructions
### Backend Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harshithmanjunath22/AI-Research-Assistant.git
   cd AI-Research-Assistant/backend

2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

       python -m venv .venv

   On Windows:

       .\.venv\Scripts\activate

   On macOS/Linux:

       source .venv/bin/activate

3. Install Python dependencies:

       pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the backend server:**
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

5. Navigate to the frontend directory:

       cd frontend

6. Install Node dependencies:

       npm install

7. Run the Next.js development server:

       npm run dev

8. Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to interact with the assistant.

###Usage###
##1. Upload a Document:##

Use the Document Uploader to select and upload a document (PDF, DOCX, or DOC).

The backend will parse and summarize the document, storing relevant information and print the summarised information in the UI.

##2. Customize the Assistant:##

Select the assistant’s personality (factual, friendly, humorous) from the Personality Selector.

##3. Chat Interface:##

Ask questions about the document.

Use the deep research button (magnifying glass icon) to have the assistant fetch additional information online using SerpAPI.

The assistant will respond you with accurate answer
